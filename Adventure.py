# Welcome to Stargate: SCSI-1! A Text Based Adventure

# To win, go to the north room and take the key
# go back south to the main room
# go south and examine the socket and you will
# enter the secret room!
# In the secret room, take the logic board
# You will wind up back in the main room
# Go east and take the necklace
# Head back west to the main room
# Go west to the west room
# Examine the gyroscope to win!

# To LOSE, do everything above, except you will also
# take the book in the in the east room, which adds
# a "tablet" to your inventory
# When you examine the gyroscope in the west room,
# You will get the bad ending.

# You can also get a losing condition by talking to
# the chair in the north room.
